                This video is a gaming one I made to practice youtube gaming content. I'm not a very entertaining person here 
                but there was an attempt. I also practice my photoshop for the thumbnail. Pretty simple and unentertaining, 
                but practice is practice.

                Here is a video I edited for a production class, with the focus being on editing fluidly in a PKG style, using sots,
                some clean quick shots, and good continuity. This one is pretty well edited, though the videography isn't very good,
                and the audio and video required some heavy clean up in post.
            </p>

                Videography is a pretty weak point of mine, and this project focused on that. A classmate and I worked here to take
                good film of nearby outdoor locations and make a video explaining them all. Here, the editing is rough and rushed,
                since the focus is on videography.

                My greatest creation ever is unironically a parody of Eminem's "Without Me". Some friends and I made this for our
                econ class. I didn't do much of the writing but I was one of the main videographers for our group and I did all
                of the editng and vfx. I personally love it and think that for editing it in a day it is a masterpiece.
