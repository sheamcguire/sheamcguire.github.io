                For filming and videography, my main tool is a digital camera with an external microphone. It makes a great high-rez
                quick use camera. The mic is high quality, and in combination with a camera phone I am able to get a lot
                of high quality creative shots easily.

                I built this computer a while back for a gaming and work set up, and it currently serves as my main tool for
                video editing and post-production work. It has a 1050ti as the main graphics card, which works pretty well whenever
                rendering effects in premiere or after effects.

            <p class="creative">
                The main editing software that I use is adobe premiere. I get it pretty cheap because of the student discount, and it
                is a really useful software for production. I also utilize the rest of the adobe suite in a lot of the things I do.
                The graphics for this website were made in photoshop, and a I like to do most effects in after effects.

            <p class="obs">
                When I want to practice gaming related or youtube style content, my main tool is OBS or Streamlabs (which is made by OBS).
                I can use it to record videos myself, or to screen record anything else happening on my monitors that I think could be
                assets or fun things to turn into a cool video project.
