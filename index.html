                My name is Shea, and I am a video editor who does some videography in my freetime.
                This website is going to explore some of the things I have made and the tools I use to make them.
                Here is a quick synopsis me: I am someone who loves creativity and making cool things, but completely lacks creativity.
                Working with simple shapes and colors is pretty appealing because of that, but I also think the highlighter vibes of pink, yellow,
                and cyan represent me pretty well. In my freetime I mostly play video games, but I like to try making videos about those video games.
                I am working on becoming a post production expert by practicing my editing, vfx, and graphic design. Graphic design is a skill
                that I really lack but am working on making it better. Some other things I like are writing, cooking, and swimming.

                I want to make videos for a living some day, whether that be videography, editing, or, <i>the best of the best</i>, a content creator of some sort. Here is the greatest video I've made so far:

                    <li>My bed is really high off the ground and really big which is quite nice.</li>
                </ul>
