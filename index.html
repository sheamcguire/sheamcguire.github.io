        <p>I want to make videos for a living some day, whether that be videography, editing, or, <i>the best of the best</i>, a content creator of some sort. Here is the greatest video I've made so far:</p> <br>

                <source src="feelslikethegdp.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>

            The things I think that I like the most in my room are: <ul>
                <li>My cat.</li>
                <li>My frickin awesome PC.</li>
                <li>I've got a really cool minifridge that I keep yogurt in.</li>
                <li>My bed is really high off the ground and really big which is quite nice.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            My three favorite foods are: <ol>
                <li>Tacos</li>
                <li>Rice</li>
                <li>Basically anything with cream cheese (crepes, cheesecake, etc.)</li>
            </ol>
